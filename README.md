# Express Bootstrap

The purpose of this project is to create a template for a web site using Express.

Express is bare-bones, which is good, but there some features you will need. Such as

- Livereload
- Logging
- Reading the environment
- Linting and formating

I am trying to make an Express template that is as simple as possible. That also provides what we always use in every project.

## Stack

The installed stack is:

- Express
- Handlebars
- Morgan
- Dotenv
- Livereload / Connect-livereload
- Nodemon
- Vite
- Eslint
- Prettier

## Install

1. Clone this project and install the dependencies. I am using yarn but feel free to change it.
2. Make .env file with the contents of .env.example

And that is it.
